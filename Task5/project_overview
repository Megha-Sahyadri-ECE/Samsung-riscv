# TASK 5
# PROJECT: Parking Assistant System

# OVERVIEW

The Parking Assistant System is designed to help drivers park their vehicles safely by using an ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance between the car and an obstacle. Based on the measured distance, LED indicators light up in different colors to alert the driver:

Green LED: Safe distance (no need to stop).

Yellow LED: Caution (medium distance, slow down).

Red LED: Danger (very close, stop immediately).

The system continuously measures the distance and updates the LED status in real time, providing a visual parking assistant.
